                My name is Philip Reji Rajan. I am a 3rd year BCA undergraduate at Kristu Jayanti College (Autonomous), Bangalore.
                I was first introduced to coding back in 8th grade and the first language I learnt was Java.
                After that, I have been exposed to a variety of languages such as C++ while in 11th & 12th, C, VB.NET and again Java in college.
                <br>
                <br>
                I tried experimenting with Python and JavaScript without having any prior knowledge about them myself.
                When it comes to programming I believe I'm still a complete novice but I'm determined to become a master in a particular field.
